# TypeScript Monorepo

This is a monorepo written in TypeScript that contains multiple packages and projects. It is structured to facilitate code sharing and collaboration among different teams without the burden of managing multiple repositories. This approach allows for better dependency management, streamlined development workflows, and improved code quality through shared best practices and tools.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be a challenging aspect of monorepos, as they need to be configured to handle changes across multiple packages and projects. However, with the right tools and strategies, it is possible to set up efficient CI/CD pipelines that can automatically build, test, and deploy changes to the relevant parts of the monorepo.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive example of how to set up and manage a monorepo, including best practices for organizing code, managing dependencies, and configuring CI/CD pipelines. Whether you are new to monorepos or looking to improve your existing setup, hopefully this repository can serve as a valuable resource.
